## Details

 We have built a multimodal multitask model for DR data, aiming to solve all tasks in this field with one model, such as report generation, disease detection, disease question answering, and even segmentation. Without any fine-tuning, our model has achieved satisfactory results in report generation, disease detection and question answering.
